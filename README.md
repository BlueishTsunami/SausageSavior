# Sausage Savior

A skeleton of a game i created as part of a game jam. The game jame concept was to create any game involving food. The project uses Unity, most of the code outside of boilerplate and all of the art was created by me. I use Aseprite to create art and animations. While i never completed the game, most of the core mechanics are in place. 

Mechanics: 
- You are a sausage
- You have to maintain your temperature
- There are pickups that boost you (Mustard, ketchup, bun)
- (Not Completed) You're ending score for a level will depend on temperature, and how many pickups you have. A perfect score is cooked just right with all of the fixings. 

Areas of note: 
- Created a customized character controller for movement. The default boilerplate controllers in unity are not the best, so I needed to create a controller that would allow for better platforming controls. Things to keep in mind are precision, momentum, and general feel for the player.
-  I created all of the graphics in the game by hand. While they may not look impressive, this is a painstaking effort. Getting the pickups to sync with the character visually was tough at first.
-  Midway through the project, Unity had some major updates that messed with my project. Hopefully I'll pick it up again oneday. 

Check it out at the github.io deployment, hope you have fun!:
